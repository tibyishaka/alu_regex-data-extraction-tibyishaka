# Alu Regex Data Extraction
 ## The Task
To extract the required data from the hundreds of thousands of pages of string response you get from your API, you have decided to unleash the raw power of Regular Expressions. You already know how the specific types of data you are looking for appear in the string. This is how you have summarized that information, now all you have to do is write your Regular Expressions.

You have designed an API that aggregates data from all over the web and displays relevant information based on the user's request. Here is the list of data types that need to be extracted from hundreds of pages of strings: 

- Email addresses
- URLs
- Phone numbers
- Credit card numbers
- Time in 12-hour or 24-hour format
- HTML tags
- Hashtags
- Currency amounts
